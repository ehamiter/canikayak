Can I Kayak (the Harpeth River in Tennessee, Generally)?

Basically, I wanted a quick and convenient way to check on water levels on a river that I frequently kayak near my house, the Harpeth River, in Tennessee. I realize that this is probably only useful to literally dozens of people, but it's tricky to factor in all statistics that go into making these very non-scientific guesstimates based on the cubic feet of discharged water per second, coupled with gage height.

You can see if your river of interest will work by appending the USGS Site Number to the end of the URL, e.g. `https://canikayak.com/03432350`

You can [look up Site Numbers at the USGS here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory). Keep in mind it has to have gage and discharge data, and even then, it still may not parse correctly.
